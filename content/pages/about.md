# About Daniel Burke

I am Daniel Burke, the founder and principal consultant at Church Bay Consulting.

I have **9 years of experience** working in Aviation with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. My academic background includes a **BSc in Maths and Physics** and an **MSc in Artificial Intelligence**.

I have been boating my whole life, and I draw inspiration from the local surroundings of Clonrush, Whitegate, Co. Clare—where the precision of aviation meets the tranquility of the Shannon.

My mission is to help aviation companies leverage the power of AI to improve safety, efficiency, and innovation.
