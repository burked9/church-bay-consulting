# About Daniel Burke

I am Daniel Burke, the founder and principal consultant at Church Bay Consulting. With a deep passion for both aviation and artificial intelligence, I bridge the gap between these two dynamic fields.

Based in the beautiful Clonrush, Whitegate, Co. Clare, I draw inspiration from the local surroundings—where the precision of aviation meets the tranquility of the Shannon.

My mission is to help aviation companies leverage the power of AI to improve safety, efficiency, and innovation.
